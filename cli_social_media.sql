INSERT INTO `exploits` VALUES (1,'He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn\'t. She didn\'t like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints and started the tantrum he knew was coming. But this time was different. Instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands, he just stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word. Indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish. It was like a shadow, like a mist passing across her soul\'s summer day. It was strange and unfamiliar; it was a mood. She did not sit there inwardly upbraiding her husband, lamenting at Fate, which had directed her footsteps to the path which they had taken. She was just having a good cry all to herself. The mosquitoes made merry over her, biting her firm, round arms and nipping at her bare insteps. He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life. Things aren\'t going well at all with mom today. She is just a limp noodle and wants to sleep all the time. I sure hope that things get better soon.',1),(2,'The young man wanted a role model. He looked long and hard in his youth, but that role model never materialized. His only choice was to embrace all the people in his life he didn\'t want to be like. Balloons are pretty and come in different colors, different shapes, different sizes, and they can even adjust sizes as needed. But don\'t make them too big or they might just pop, and then bye-bye balloon. It\'ll be gone and lost for the rest of mankind. They can serve a variety of purposes, from decorating to water balloon wars. You just have to use your head to think a little bit about what to do with them. The wolves stopped in their tracks, sizing up the mother and her cubs. It had been over a week since their last meal and they were getting desperate. The cubs would make a good meal, but there were high risks taking on the mother Grizzly. A decision had to be made and the wrong choice could signal the end of the pack. He picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone. Day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate. He couldn\'t be sure. Day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion, but he knew it was a long time. Much too long. You can decide what you want to do in life, but I suggest doing something that creates. Something that leaves a tangible thing once you\'re done. That way even after you\'re gone, you will still live on in the things you created.',2),(3,'Do you think you\'re living an ordinary life? You are so mistaken it\'s difficult to even explain. The mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary. The odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery, but here you are. Are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass? There was no time. He ran out of the door without half the stuff he needed for work, but it didn\'t matter. He was late and if he didn\'t make this meeting on time, someone\'s life may be in danger. \"Explain to me again why I shouldn\'t cheat?\" he asked. \"All the others do and nobody ever gets punished for doing so. I should go about being happy losing to cheaters because I know that I don\'t? That\'s what you\'re telling me?\" It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don\'t at the same time. You\'re frozen with fear and unable to act. That\'s where she found herself and she didn\'t know what to do next. Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain, deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity about the man-house. In the meantime, he would go down into the canyon and get a cool drink, after which he would visit some berry patches just over the ridge, and explore among the foothills a bit before his nap-time, which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle of the sky. At that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so all of the animals, with one accord, had decided it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep.',3),(4,'Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain, deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity about the man-house.

Sometimes it\'s the first moment of the day that catches you off guard. That\'s what Wendy was thinking. She opened her window to see fire engines screeching down the street. While this wasn\'t something completely unheard of, it also wasn\'t normal. It was a sure sign of what was going to happen that day. She could feel it in her bones and it wasn\'t the way she wanted the day to begin. There are only three ways to make this work. The first is to let me take care of everything. The second is for you to take care of everything. The third is to split everything 50 / 50. I think the last option is the most preferable, but I\'m certain it\'ll also mean the end of our marriage. She tried not to judge him. His ratty clothes and unkempt hair made him look homeless. Was he really the next Einstein as she had been told? On the off chance it was true, she continued to try not to judge him. There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless. That curiosity had long left him to where he had come to loathe anything that put him out of his comfort zone.',4),(5,'I recollect that my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes. It was that terrifying feeling you have as you tightly hold the covers over you with the knowledge that there is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, but you don\'t at the same time. You\'re frozen with fear and unable to act. That\'s where she found herself and she didn\'t know what to do next. Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try. I recently discovered I could make fudge with just chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and a thick pot on slow heat. I tried it with dark chocolate chunks and I tried it with semi-sweet chocolate chips. It\'s better with both kinds. It comes out pretty bad with just the dark chocolate. The best add-ins are crushed almonds and marshmallows -- what you get from that is Rocky Road. It takes about twenty minutes from start to fridge, and then it takes about six months to work off the twenty pounds you gain from eating it. All things in moderation, friends. All things in moderation. She asked the question even though she didn\'t really want to hear the answer. It was a no-win situation since she already knew. If he told the truth, she\'d get confirmation of her worst fears. If he lied, she\'d know that he wasn\'t who she thought he was which would be almost as bad. Yet she asked the question anyway and waited for his answer.',5),(6,'Was it enough? That was the question he kept asking himself. Was being satisfied enough? He looked around him at everyone yearning to just be satisfied in their daily life and he had reached that goal. He knew that he was satisfied and he also knew it wasn\'t going to be enough. The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever. Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn\'t leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen. It was a scrape that he hardly noticed. Sure, there was a bit of blood but it was minor compared to most of the other cuts and bruises he acquired on his adventures. There was no way he could know that the rock that produced the cut had alien genetic material on it that was now racing through his bloodstream. He felt perfectly normal and continued his adventure with no knowledge of what was about to happen to him. He picked up the burnt end of the branch and made a mark on the stone. Day 52 if the marks on the stone were accurate. He couldn\'t be sure. Day and nights had begun to blend together creating confusion, but he knew it was a long time. Much too long.',6),(7,'There are different types of secrets. She had held onto plenty of them during her life, but this one was different. She found herself holding onto the worst type. It was the type of secret that could gnaw away at your insides if you didn\'t tell someone about it, but it could end up getting you killed if you did. She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn\'t the most important. The last step wasn\'t the most important. It was the next step that was the most important. The box sat on the desk next to the computer. It had arrived earlier in the day and business had interrupted her opening it earlier. She didn\'t who had sent it and briefly wondered who it might have been. As she began to unwrap it, she had no idea that opening it would completely change her life. There was a time when he would have embraced the change that was coming. In his youth, he sought adventure and the unknown, but that had been years ago. He wished he could go back and learn to find the excitement that came with change but it was useless.

All things in moderation.',1),(8,'I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase \"meant to be.\" That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. Maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that \"meant to be\" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. But that\'s my existential underpants underpinnings showing. It\'s the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie. Do you think you\'re living an ordinary life? You are so mistaken it\'s difficult to even explain. The mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary. The odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery, but here you are. Are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass? He had done everything right. There had been no mistakes throughout the entire process. It had been perfection and he knew it without a doubt, but the results still stared back at him with the fact that he had lost. He was aware there were numerous wonders of this world including the unexplained creations of humankind that showed the wonder of our ingenuity. There are huge heads on Easter Island. There are the Egyptian pyramids. There’s Stonehenge. But he now stood in front of a newly discovered monument that simply didn\'t make any sense and he wondered how he was ever going to be able to explain it. She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. \"You need to learn to think for yourself,\" she wanted to tell him. \"Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down.\" But she didn\'t because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never give them up.',2),(9,'I recently discovered I could make fudge with just chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and a thick pot on slow heat.

All things in moderation. It was a question of which of the two she preferred. On the one hand, the choice seemed simple. The more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most. It was the easy choice. The safe choice. But she wasn\'t sure she actually preferred it. He ordered his regular breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns, and two strips of bacon. He continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new. This was also part of the routine. A few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all. It was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years. He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same.

It had arrived earlier in the day and business had interrupted her opening it earlier. She didn\'t who had sent it and briefly wondered who it might have been. As she began to unwrap it, she had no idea that opening it would completely change her life. It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true. There had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was once again at a crossroads. Would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream? Dana rose and took her first step. The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever. She sat in the darkened room waiting. It was now a standoff. He had the power to put her in the room, but not the power to make her repent. It wasn\'t fair and no matter how long she had to endure the darkness, she wouldn\'t change her attitude. At three years old, Sandy\'s stubborn personality had already bloomed into full view. She considered the birds to be her friends. She\'d put out food for them each morning and then she\'d watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day. She wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her. Would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning?',8),(11,'She looked at her little girl who was about to become a teen. She tried to think back to when the girl had been younger but failed to pinpoint the exact moment when she had become a little too big to pick up and carry. It hit her all at once. She was no longer a little girl and she stood there speechless with fear, sadness, and pride all running through her at the same time. It was a concerning development that he couldn\'t get out of his mind. He\'d had many friends throughout his early years and had fond memories of playing with them, but he couldn\'t understand how it had all stopped. There was some point as he grew up that he played with each of his friends for the very last time, and he had no idea that it would be the last. Where do they get a random paragraph?\" he wondered as he clicked the generate button. Do they just write a random paragraph or do they get it somewhere? At that moment he read the random paragraph and realized it was about random paragraphs and his world would never be the same. The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years. It wore those scars with pride, feeling that they enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it. The scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty. The jacket was in its prime and it knew it. She reached her goal, exhausted. Even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought she\'d feel upon reaching it wasn\'t there. Something wasn\'t right. Was this the only feeling she\'d have for over five years of hard work?',8),(12,'The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years.

The jacket was in its prime and it knew it. It had become a far too common an event in her life. She has specifically placed the key to the box in a special place so that she wouldn\'t lose it and know exactly where it was when the key was needed. Now that she needed to open the box, she had absolutely no idea where that special spot she placed the key might be. She reached her goal, exhausted. Even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought she\'d feel upon reaching it wasn\'t there. Something wasn\'t right. Was this the only feeling she\'d have for over five years of hard work? She patiently waited for his number to be called. She had no desire to be there, but her mom had insisted that she go. She\'s resisted at first, but over time she realized it was simply easier to appease her and go. Mom tended to be that way. She would keep insisting until you wore down and did what she wanted. So, here she sat, patiently waiting for her number to be called.

Both were curious, but only one was brave enough to want to explore. That was the problem. There was always one that let fear rule her life.',11),(14,'As she sat watching the world go by, something caught her eye. It wasn\'t so much its color or shape, but the way it was moving. She squinted to see if she could better understand what it was and where it was going, but it didn\'t help. As she continued to stare into the distance, she didn\'t understand why this uneasiness was building inside her body. She felt like she should get up and run. If only she could make out what it was. At that moment, she comprehended what it was and where it was heading, and she knew her life would never be the same. Do you think you\'re living an ordinary life?

Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down the mountain, deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his curiosity about the man-house.

At that period of the day the sun’s warm rays seemed to cast a sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so all of the animals, with one accord, had decided it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep. It was difficult for him to admit he was wrong. He had been so certain that he was correct and the deeply held belief could never be shaken. Yet the proof that he had been incorrect stood right before his eyes. \"See daddy, I told you that they are real!\" his daughter excitedly proclaimed. It\'s not his fault. I know you\'re going to want to, but you can\'t blame him. He really has no idea how it happened. I kept trying to come up with excuses I could say to mom that would keep her calm when she found out what happened, but the more I tried, the more I could see none of them would work. He was going to get her wrath and there was nothing I could say to prevent it.',2),(15,'It was a weird concept. Why would I really need to generate a random paragraph?

She wiggled her fingers hoping to touch something, but all she felt was air. She shifted the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole. Her fingers still touched nothing but air. \"What is the best way to get what you want?\" she asked. He looked down at the ground knowing that she wouldn\'t like his answer. He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt. How was he going to tell her that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her?
